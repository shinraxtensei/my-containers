let’s talk about some essential concepts before diving
into the actual implementation of containers :
1 - exception safety and RAII

https://scvgoe.github.io/2019-07-06-Exception-Safety/
https://www.boost.org/community/exception_safety.html
so what is exception safety?
before I answer that I should first introduce to you an important concept which is stack
unwinding
stack unwinding :
when a function is called, information about that routine gets stacked
up on the call stack inside a frame. Each function(subroutine)
gets its own frame with whatever information instruction needs
the CPU to execute that function.
now when the function finishes its execution, its frame gets
destroyed and the CPU executes the next function in a FILO order
When an exception occurs
while a function is in
docs 2
progress on the stack, it
returns to the call stack by
finding the catch block, it
just keeps returning
through the execution
path. resulting in the
destruction of the function
frame.
if there is any memory
allocated before the
exception throw, memory
leaks will occur
docs 3
void f3() {
int *c = new int[100]; // will be leak
std::string s = "this is stack... would be destroyed";
throw "exception!";
}
void f2() { f3() }
void f1() { try { f2() } catch (...) { std::cout << "back to here!\n"; } }
• f1->f2->f3 Stacks are stacked in  f3->f2->f1 order, and stacks are released in order.
docs 4
the exception will follow that execution path until it finds the catch block,
 destroying function frames without giving a damn about allocated memory
Levels of exception safety :
now that we know what exception safety is let us discover the levels of exception
safety
and at what level our code should be exception safe
Exception safety has four levels. (sort by safe order)
1. No-throw guarantee
(failure transparency): At a level that guarantees the success and safety of all
operations, when an exceptional situation occurs, it is handled internally, and
success and stability are guaranteed without being visible to clients.
2. Strong exception safety
(commit or rollback semantics): The operation may fail, but it is guaranteed that
the failed operation does not cause other side effects. Therefore, all data retains
its original values.
3. Basic exception safety
(no-leak guarantee): Although some actions of a failed operation can cause side
effects, all invariants are always preserved and no resource leaks including
memory leaks are guaranteed. The existing data stored may change its value,
but it will still have a valid value.
4. No exception safety
: a level in which nothing is guaranteed. In general, a level of at least basic
exception safety is required for a robust code. A high level of safety is difficult to
achieve and may incur overhead due to additional copies. The key to exception
safety is to ensure that program execution continues even after a block of code
(even if it is an exception) is executed. Some languages make this simple by
using the dispose pattern (with, try-with-resources).

How to: Design for Exception Safety In
C++
1. Keep Resource Classes Simple
: When encapsulating a manual resource in a class, you should do nothing but
manage the resource. Also, it is better to use a smart pointer if possible.
2. Use the RAII Idiom to Manage Resources
: RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) Idiom is a design pattern proposed
by Bjarne Stroustrup, the creator of C++. The RAII pattern is an important
technique to prevent leaks in languages such as C++ where the developer
needs to directly manage the resource. It releases the resource automatically
when the scope of use of the resource ends, and the resource is acquired even
when an exception occurs. It must be ensured that this

Resource Acquisition is Initialization is a c++ technique that ensures that the
allocated resources will be released
it consists of creating an object that will encapsulate and manage the resource
Acquisition/allocation in the constructor. and release that resource in the destructor.

- Functors (Function Objects):
resources
MS functor vs lambda expression
what are c++ functors and their uses (StackOverflow 따봉 1000개)
about functor
function object Wikipedia
As the name shows, Functor is a combination of a function and an object.
it's an object that behaves like a function. and that’s by overloading the () operator
functors are widely used in STL algorithms
struct Add{
Add(int toAdd) : _toAdd(toAdd) {}
int operator()(int x){
return x + _toAdd;
}
private:
int _toAdd;
};
int main(){
docs 7
Add add_42(42); // state
Add add_13(13);
int result_42 = add_42(2);
int result_13 = add_13(2);
std::vector<int> v(10, 10);
std::transform(v.begin(), v.end(), v.begin(), add_42);
}
Classification of functors
generator: a functor with no arguments
unary: a functor that takes one argument
binary: a functor that takes two arguments
predicate: Used as a functor that returns a boolean value, Unary predicate, Binary
predicate, etc.
operator: a functor that returns an operation value
functor vs function
A functor is an object that operates like a function by overloading the () operator on
the object.
Because it is an object, it can be passed as an argument and can be used in the
form of a callback.
Because it is a callback type, it is compatible with STL's algorithm.
the state can be stored
To pass a function as an argument to a specific function, you need to do something
else (function pointer or function object).
functor vs function pointer
A functor has a clearly defined type.
Therefore, it can also be used as a template argument.
Optimization is possible in the compilation stage, so it can be inlined.
It can store state and can also have regular member variables/functions.
docs 8
A large amount of code is required to create a structure or class.
A function pointer can contain other functions as long as the type is the same.
It is not determined at compile time, but the function is determined at runtime, so
overhead occurs and cannot be inlined.
The state cannot be saved.
function vs lambda expression (c++11)
Both can be inlined and lambda expression defaults to inline.
A lambda expression is similar to a functor, but it is simpler because there is no need
to define a class. Feels like syntax sugar
2- SFINAE
- SFINAE (Substitution Failure Is Not An Error)
resources
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_failure_is_not_an_error#:~:text=Substitution
failure is not an error (SFINAE) refers to a,to describe related programming
techniques.
before we define what SFINAE really is, let's first see how the compiler chooses the right
function overload to call.
in c++, the compiler goes through a process in order for it to find the right function
overload.
these steps are:
1 name lookup
in this step, the compiler looks for candidate functions that have the same name
this step consists of two different types of lookup :
• unqualified name lookup: to put it simply, in this type of lookup, there’s a
search for the namespace, if there’s one, otherwise we check in the global
namespace;
docs 9
• qualified name lookup: in this type of lookup, we search more specifically
for the function name in the namespace that we found in the unqualified
name lookup
2 • ADL (Argument Dependent Lookup) :
ADL is the set of rules for looking up the unqualified function names
in function-call expressions, including implicit function, calls to overloaded
operators.
the argument-dependent lookup is not considered if the lookup set
produced by the usual unqualified lookup contains any of the following:
1) a declaration of a class member
2) a declaration of a function at block scope (that's not a usingdeclaration)
3) any declaration that is not a function or a function template (e.g. a
function object or another variable whose name conflicts with the name of
the function that's being looked up)
for every argument in a function call expression, its type is examined to
determine the associated set of namespaces and classes that it will add to
the lookup.
1. For arguments of fundamental type, the associated set of
namespaces and classes is empty
2. For arguments of class type (including union) …
3. For arguments whose type is a class template specialization …
4. For arguments of enumeration type …
5. For arguments of type pointer to T or pointer to an array of T …
6. For arguments of function type, the function parameter types and the
function return type are examined and their associated set of classes
and namespaces are added to the set.
7. For arguments of type pointer to member function F of class X …
8. For arguments of type pointer to data member T of class X …
9. ….

3 template argument deduction
 - at this point, Template functions are untyped and need to be instantiated.
 - A template function is instantiated, either explicitly or implicitly, but not always all
arguments of the template are determined.
 - At this point, if possible, the compiler deduces the template argument.
 - In this way, a candidate function set is created, and more than one function can be
a candidate.
4 • template argument substitution
7 - Substitute function arguments in the list, but if there is a problem with the type or
expression, the substitution fails
8 - When substitution fails, it does not generate a compile error and works by
excluding the candidate function from the candidate group! (SFINAE)
5 - overload resolution
 Find the function actually called through overload resolution!
 At this time, the function candidates are  candidate functions called, and the function
actually called  viable function is called!
💡 SFINAE applies during overload resolution of function templates:
When substituting
 the explicitly specified or deduced type for the template parameter fails, the
specialization is discarded from the overload set, instead of causing a compile
error.
docs 11
💡 Substitution failure is not an error (SFINAE) refers to a situation
in C++ where an invalid substitution of template parameters is not in itself
an error. David Vandevoorde first introduced the acronym SFINAE to
describe related programming techniques.[1]
Specifically, when creating a candidate set for overload resolution, some
(or all) candidates of that set may be the result of instantiated templates
with (potentially deduced) template arguments substituted for the
corresponding template parameters. If an error occurs during the
substitution of a set of arguments for any given template, the compiler
removes the potential overload from the candidate set instead of stopping
with a compilation error, provided the substitution error is one the C++
standard grants such treatment.[2] If one or more candidates remain and
overload resolution succeeds, the invocation is well-formed.
in the next section, we will see how we can use SFINAE to our
advantage, through type traits, and tag dispatching ….

A quick primer on type traits in modern C++
Type traits are a clever technique used in C++ template
metaprogramming that gives you the ability to inspect and
transform the properties of types. For example, given a

https://dev.to/sandordargo/what-are-type-traits-in-c-18j5
docs 12
https://cs.brown.edu/~jwicks/boost/libs/type_traits/cxx_type_traits.htm
so what are type traits?
let's start with what is a trait.
a trait is "a particular characteristic that can produce a
particular type of behavior". Or simply "a characteristic,
especially of a personality".
we can think about type traits as properties of a type .
you'd often need the information on what kind of types are accepted by a template,
and what types are supported by certain operations. While concepts are much
superior in terms of expressiveness or usability, with type traits you could already
introduce compile-time conditions on what should be accepted as valid code and
what not.
Though type traits can help with even more. With their help, you can also add or
remove the  const  specifier, you can turn a pointer or a reference into a value, and so
on….
Type traits are a clever technique used in C++ template
metaprogramming that gives you the ability to inspect and
transform the properties of types.
For example, given a generic type  T  — it could
be  int ,  bool ,  std::vector , or whatever you want — with type
traits you can ask the compiler some questions: is it an integer? Is
it a function? Is it a pointer? Or maybe a class? Does it have a
destructor? Can you copy it? Will it throw exceptions? ... and so
on. This is extremely useful in conditional compilation, where
docs 13
you instruct the compiler to pick the right path according to the
type in input. We will see an example shortly.
💡 Generic programming (writing code that works with any data type meeting
a set of requirements) has become the method of choice for providing
reusable code. However, there are times in generic programming when
"generic" just isn't good enough - sometimes the differences between types
are too large for an efficient generic implementation. This is when the traits
technique becomes important - by encapsulating those properties that
need to be considered on a type-by-type basis inside a traits class, we can
minimize the amount of code that has to differ from one type to another and
maximize the amount of generic code.
